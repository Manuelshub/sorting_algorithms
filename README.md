## Introduction

This Repository contains files for the ALX C - sorting algorithms and Big O. The goal is to implement and explore different sorting algorithms in the C programming language, emphasizing the understanding of Big O notation for evaluating time complexity. This project is designed for teams of two students to pair program, focusing on the implementation of at least four different sorting algorithms and gaining an understanding of Big O notation.

## Objective

This Sorting Algorithm's project aims to achieve the following:

1. **Sorting Algorithms Implementation:** Implement at least four different sorting algorithms in C, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort.

2. **Big O Notation Mastery:** Develop a solid understanding of Big O notation and its application to evaluate the time complexity of sorting algorithms. Document the Big O notations for each algorithm in the provided files.

3. **Stable Sorting:** Gain practical experience in implementing stable sorting algorithms and comprehend their significance in specific use cases.

4. **Collaborative Learning:** Foster collaboration and pair programming skills within the team of two students throughout the project timeline.

5. **Code Quality and Style:** Adhere to coding standards, specifically the Betty style, and maintain code quality through efficient algorithms and concise, well-documented code.
